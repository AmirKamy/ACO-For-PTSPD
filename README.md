# ACO-For-PTSPD
This project implements an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm enhanced with Levy Flight to solve the Probabilistic Traveling Salesman Problem with Deadlines (PTSPD). The approach improves exploration and prevents premature convergence, making it more effective in handling probabilistic constraints and deadlines in route optimization. ðŸš€
